    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Although my interactions with Mr. Logston were short, I remember he was always
very hospitable. When I visited Paul, his son, at their house in Hercules,
Mr. Logston would be sitting in his recliner watching the tv near the kitchen.
Usually, he would offer me a seat to join in on the fun. If I was in the kitchen
sitting at the island, he would get up and talk to me, offer me juice, water,
milk, a snack, even an entire meal. When Paul and I would get ready to go,
Mr. Logston would walk us out to say good-bye to Paul, chat for a little bit,
and checked in on the cats that Paul threw off the car as he walked back into
the house. He was a very loving father and made sure his sons' friends always
felt welcome under their roof, which was always the case for me.</p>
