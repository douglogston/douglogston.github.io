little I knew him... the famously picky eater, &amp;quot;But what IS it?&amp;quot; and
the cleaning obsession (vacuuming in the middle of a Christmas party
was a new one to me) but he was consistent about one thing - he always
lit up when Paul or Christopher entered the room. He loved his boys,
he really LOVED his boys and it showed on his face. How lucky you both
were to have that in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love,
Laurie&lt;/p&gt;
