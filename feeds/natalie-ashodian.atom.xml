over) were the 1-2, 1-2s! we'd beg him to do. Toss us in the pool over his head
at the old condo community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I had two pairs of his old work jeans, they took me through high school
and college. The best naturally &amp;quot;distressed&amp;quot; jeans a girl could ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my mom still has some of his black jeans from later that she made bags
out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also told me not to eat to many bananas or I'd &amp;quot;get the runs&amp;quot; and not to
&amp;quot;carry so much money in your wallet or you might lose it&amp;quot; ...I hoarded my good
report card money and carried it around around in my little kid wallet 'cause
i thought it made me mature. It did not. It made me an oddly cash rich kid.
