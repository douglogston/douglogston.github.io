    <article class="post-content">
      <p>I've known your dad for a number of years even before your mom and dad
where married. What I didn't know about him was he need to clean. When
my son Ricky was about 10 he used to stop at your Condo on the way back
from school, when I picked him up I stayed a bit and talked to your mom
until your dad came home. When he came in he immediately started to organize
and clean the house, out came the vacuum cleaner and all the toys you guys were
playing with had to be picked up and put away even if you were in the middle
of playing everything had to be put away and he started vacuuming, once he
stopped with the vacuum he started in on the kitchen even if Eileen had just
cleaned it before he came home, I was dumbfounded on how he could work all day
and then come home and do this, I asked Eileen if he was OCD she said yep and
it was his way of winding down from the day, I thought if he needed more
unwinding he could come to my place and un-wind a little more I had loads of
therapy for him at my house.</p>
<p>The other thing was how he loved and supported his boy's he loved to watch
them in their numerous roles and always had an encouraging word for them after
their performances in whatever play they were in.</p>
<p>He was a kind and generous man that loved his entire family.</p>
